  - `task_events` - Complete audit trail
  - `pod_records` - Proof of delivery with photos/signatures
  - `drivers` - Driver registry with stats
  - `vehicles` - Fleet management
  - `logistics_config` - Configurable settings (MLC god-mode)
  - `exception_types` - Exception management
  - `site_zones` - GPS geofencing
- RLS policies defined
- Indexing strategy

  4. Average Turnaround (by site pair)
  5. Fleet Utilization (%, idle time)
  6. POD Completeness (photos, signatures, GPS)
- Export to CSV/PDF

  2. Site Zones & Geofences
  3. Drivers & Vehicles
  4. Notification Rules

  6. Feature Toggles
- Mirrors MC Backend spec structure
- Full CRUD on all config

  - Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
  - Phase 2: Task Management (Weeks 3-4)
  - Phase 3: Driver App (Weeks 5-6)
  - Phase 4: POD System (Week 7)
  - Phase 5: Materials Integration (Week 8)
  - Phase 6: Reporting (Week 9)
  - Phase 7: Configuration (Week 10)
  - Phase 8: Polish & Testing (Weeks 11-12)
- Clear deliverables per phase
- Dependencies identified
- Checkpoint/demo schedule

### 12. Testing Strategy ✅
- **Unit tests** (Jest):
  - Service layer (80%+ coverage)
  - Utilities and helpers
  - State management
- **Integration tests**:
  - API endpoints
  - Event flows (Materials ↔ Logistics)
  - Database operations
- **E2E tests** (Playwright):
  - Critical user flows
  - Driver task execution
  - POD capture
  - MLC queue management
- **Performance tests**:
  - Page load (<2s p95)
  - API response (<500ms p95)
  - Event delivery (<10s p99)

## 📄 PLANNING DOCUMENTS

### Main Document
- **`LOGISTICS_APP_PLAN.md`** (18,000+ words)
  - Complete technical specification
  - Database schema with SQL
  - API endpoint definitions
  - Component architecture
  - Code samples and examples
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Acceptance criteria

### Supporting Documents (Referenced)
- **`PLANNING.md`** - Overall SCM Hub planning
- **`MC_BACKEND_SPEC.md`** - Materials Coordinator backend (mirror for MLC)
- **`DATA_FLOW.md`** - Integration patterns
- **`ADR-002-event-system.md`** - Redis Streams architecture
- **`ADR-001-monorepo-tooling.md`** - Turborepo setup

## 🎯 KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Standalone System (not Materials child)
**Rationale:** Logistics serves multiple clients (Materials, Maintenance, Projects), not just Materials.

### 2. Event-Driven Integration (Redis Streams)
**Rationale:** Loose coupling, reliable delivery, scales to 100k+ events/hr, already using Redis.

### 3. PWA for Driver App (not native mobile)
**Rationale:** Single codebase, no app store, offline-first, device API access (camera, GPS, push).

### 4. Supabase for Backend (not custom API)
**Rationale:** RLS for security, real-time subscriptions, auth built-in, storage included.

### 5. Configurable Everything (MLC god-mode)
**Rationale:** Business logic changes frequently, MLC needs control without developer dependency.

### 6. Offline-First Driver App
**Rationale:** Unreliable field connectivity, POD capture can't fail due to network.

## 🔍 OPEN QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDER

Before starting implementation, clarify:

1. **Request Types:** What are the initial request types beyond Delivery/Collection?
2. **SLA Targets:** Specific hours for each type?
3. **GPS Radius:** Acceptable tolerance (50m? 100m? 200m?)
4. **Photo Requirements:** Min/max photos per POD?
5. **Signature:** Mandatory for certain types?
6. **Driver Assignment:** Auto-assign or always manual?
7. **Priority Levels:** Use P1-P4 or different scale?
8. **Notifications:** Email, SMS, Teams, or Push? Who gets what?
9. **Approvals:** Approval chains for any request types?
10. **Integrations:** Other systems beyond Materials? (Maintenance, Projects?)

---

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (from spec)

All 4 acceptance criteria planned:

- **AC-01:** ✅ Requester can create any task type via form
- **AC-02:** ✅ Dispatcher assigns and driver receives within 10s (via Supabase Realtime)
- **AC-03:** ✅ Status update syncs to linked MRF if applicable (via Redis Streams events)
- **AC-04:** ✅ POD capture offline, auto-sync on reconnect (via IndexedDB + Service Worker)
