- [x] Test picking workflow (Qube user picks items)
- [x] Test status transitions (Submitted → Picking → Staged → In Transit → Delivered)
- [x] Test status history tracking when status changes
- [x] Test auto-unlock when status changes to Delivered/Cancelled
- [x] Test AC Dashboard filters and counts
- [x] Test Qube Pick List sorting and filtering
- [x] Test Material Request view refresh logic

### Medium Priority Tests
- [ ] Test pack badge display in WO Materials table
- [ ] Test user switching from hub
- [ ] Test navigation between views
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test table column visibility toggling
- [ ] Test table sorting
- [ ] Test table filtering
- [ ] Test search functionality across views

### Edge Case Tests
- [x] What happens if you try to request locked materials?
- [x] What happens if you try to request materials already in an active MRF?
- [x] What happens if a pack has mixed statuses?
- [x] What happens if navigation params are null?
- [x] What happens if mock data is empty?
- [x] What happens on mobile viewport?

### Integration Tests
- [x] Create MRF as requestor, verify it appears in Qube pick list
- [x] Pick items as Qube user, verify status updates in requestor view
- [x] Complete picking, verify status progression
- [x] Test backwards status transitions with reason prompt
- [x] Test On Hold workflow with notifications
- [x] Test Cancelled workflow with auto-unlock

**Comprehensive E2E Test Suite Created:**
- Location: `tests/e2e/critical-workflows.test.ts`
- Test utilities: `tests/testUtils.ts`
- Covers all critical workflows and edge cases
- Run with: `npm run test`

## Bugs Fixed
1. **Pack selection dependency** - Fixed missing `masterGridData` in useCallback deps
2. **Mock data status** - Updated deprecated "Exception" to new status types

---

## Next Testing Phase
Focus on end-to-end user workflows:
1. Requestor creates MRF
2. Qube user sees in pick list
3. Qube user picks items
4. Status updates propagate
5. Request completes delivery
