## Tests Still Needed

### High Priority Tests
- [ ] Test material request creation end-to-end (requestor → pick list)
- [ ] Test picking workflow (Qube user picks items)
- [ ] Test status transitions (Submitted → Picking → Staged → In Transit → Delivered)
- [ ] Test status history tracking when status changes
- [ ] Test auto-unlock when status changes to Delivered/Cancelled
- [ ] Test AC Dashboard filters and counts
- [ ] Test Qube Pick List sorting and filtering
- [ ] Test Material Request view refresh logic

### Medium Priority Tests
- [ ] Test pack badge display in WO Materials table
- [ ] Test user switching from hub
- [ ] Test navigation between views
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test table column visibility toggling
- [ ] Test table sorting
- [ ] Test table filtering
- [ ] Test search functionality across views

### Edge Case Tests
- [ ] What happens if you try to request locked materials?
- [ ] What happens if you try to request materials already in an active MRF?
- [ ] What happens if a pack has mixed statuses?
- [ ] What happens if navigation params are null?
- [ ] What happens if mock data is empty?
- [ ] What happens on mobile viewport?

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create MRF as requestor, verify it appears in Qube pick list
- [ ] Pick items as Qube user, verify status updates in requestor view
- [ ] Complete picking, verify status progression
- [ ] Test backwards status transitions with reason prompt
- [ ] Test On Hold workflow with notifications
- [ ] Test Cancelled workflow with auto-unlock

## Bugs Fixed
1. **Pack selection dependency** - Fixed missing `masterGridData` in useCallback deps
2. **Mock data status** - Updated deprecated "Exception" to new status types

---

## Next Testing Phase
Focus on end-to-end user workflows:
1. Requestor creates MRF
2. Qube user sees in pick list
3. Qube user picks items
4. Status updates propagate
5. Request completes delivery
