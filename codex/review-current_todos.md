# Review: `CURRENT_TODOS.md`

## Purpose
This review evaluates whether the in-repo task board in `CURRENT_TODOS.md` still reflects the current state of the program and provides actionable guidance for anyone planning the next iteration of work.

## Inputs Reviewed
- `CURRENT_TODOS.md` (last review timestamp placeholder `{{DATE:2025-10-09}}`).
- `AGENT_STATUS.md` which is expected to mirror live progress but still reports Agent 3 at 0/15 complete and Agent 1 mid-way through earlier tasks.
- `COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW.md` which reports 59/70 tasks complete and Agent 3 at 100%.
- `PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for cross-checking agent assignments and dependency notes.

These sources disagree on who has finished what, signaling that the TODO board has drifted from reality.

## Key Findings
1. **Agent 3 status conflicts** – `CURRENT_TODOS.md` still lists all integrations tasks as open even though the completion summaries and master plan document them as delivered. This creates noise and hides the true remaining work for Agent 1.
2. **Stale progress snapshot** – The “Last reviewed” field still contains the templated value from 2025-10-09, making it unclear when the board was last audited.
3. **Missing hygiene tasks** – There is no task tracking the work required to keep planning files in sync or to reconcile differences between the live status board and the TODO list.
4. **Dependencies not cross-referenced** – Several entries call out dependencies on Agent 3 deliverables that are already complete; we should track the cleanup work needed to update those notes and unblock Agent 1.

## Recommended Updates
- Reconcile the Agent 3 section so it reflects reality (either mark completed items or replace with follow-up integration tasks that remain).
- Add explicit backlog items that cover documentation hygiene (e.g., syncing dates, validating dependencies, aligning with live status board).
- Document a recurring review cadence so the board stays trustworthy.

## Resulting Tasks
The following follow-up items were added to `CURRENT_TODOS.md` so that they are visible to the broader team:

1. **plan-01 — Reconcile CURRENT_TODOS with live status sources**
   - Align Agent sections with `AGENT_STATUS.md`, `COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW.md`, and `PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
   - Capture any newly surfaced integration follow-ups instead of legacy backlog entries.
2. **plan-02 — Establish planning hygiene workflow**
   - Define a recurring review cadence and update the “Last reviewed” field programmatically or through a documented checklist.
   - Ensure dependency callouts reflect the latest completed work.

Updating these two items should restore confidence in the TODO board and make it clear which delivery work actually remains.
