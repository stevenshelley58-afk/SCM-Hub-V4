# Separate Requestor Roles Plan

1. audit-current-users — Inspect `services/api.ts`, `OperationsHub`, and logistics components to catalogue how the two requestor roles are defined and referenced.
2. define-new-ids — Update data structures to give MRF and Logistics requestors unique IDs/names while preserving their intended permissions.
3. align-ui-nav — Adjust user-switching menus, labels, and navLinks so each role routes to the proper views without conflicts.
4. validate-usage — Search for code relying on the old identifiers (e.g., `'requestor'`) and update logic, tests, and mock data accordingly.
5. regression-check — Build and manually verify that both requestor roles load their dashboards correctly and that other roles remain unaffected.
