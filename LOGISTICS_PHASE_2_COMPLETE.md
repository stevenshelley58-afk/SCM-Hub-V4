## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Smart Filtering Logic
```typescript
const filteredTasks = tasks.filter(task => {
    // Search across multiple fields
    if (searchTerm) {
        const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
        const matchesSearch = 
            task.task_number.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
            task.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
            task.pickup.location.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
            task.dropoff.location.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
            task.requester.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower);
        
        if (!matchesSearch) return false;
    }
    
    // Apply status, type, priority filters
    // ... (all filters work together)
    
    return true;
});
```

### Live SLA Updates
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    const updateCountdown = () => {
        const now = new Date().getTime();
        const target = new Date(slaTargetAt).getTime();
        const diff = target - now;
        
        // Calculate hours and minutes remaining
        // Set urgency level based on time left
        // Update every minute
    };
    
    const interval = setInterval(updateCountdown, 60000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [slaTargetAt]);
```

   - Clear labels and placeholders
   - Required field indicators

2. **Visual Feedback**

   - Task counts on filter buttons
   - Clear "no results" messaging

3. **Efficient Workflow**
   - Modal form doesn't navigate away
   - Instant refresh after task creation
   - Quick filter buttons
   - Search + filters work together

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Form is scrollable for long content

- **Live Updates:** SLA timers update without full re-render
- **Smart State:** Only re-fetch when needed

---

## 📝 What's NOT Done (Deferred)

These features were planned for Phase 2 but deferred to later phases:

### Drag-Drop Reordering (Deferred)
- Requires external library (react-beautiful-dnd)
- Would add complexity
- Manual assignment works for now

### Real-time Updates (Deferred to Phase 6)
- Requires Supabase Realtime setup
- Manual refresh works for now
- Will add in Phase 6

### Status Transition Modal (Deferred)
- Basic status updates work via assignment
- Full state machine comes in Phase 3
- Not critical for MVP

---

## 🎯 Next Steps: Phase 3

Phase 3 will focus on the **Driver Mobile App** improvements:

1. **POD Capture Enhancement**
   - Actual camera integration
   - Signature pad component
   - GPS capture
   - Photo preview

2. **Driver Experience**
   - Better task detail view
   - Navigation integration
   - Offline support
   - Push notifications

3. **Task Lifecycle**
   - Complete state machine
   - Status validation
   - Event tracking
   - Audit trail UI
