## Next Steps for Other Agents

### Agent 1 (Core Workflows)
**Recommended:**
1. Start with impl-43 (POD capture) - Use `photoService.ts`
2. Implement impl-45 (Delivery confirmation) - Use `notificationService.ts`
3. Add impl-44 (ETA tracking) - Use `ltrIntegrationService.ts`

**Integration Example:**
```typescript
// POD Capture
import { uploadPhoto } from '../services/photoService';
const result = await uploadPhoto(file, mrfId, 'pod', userName, notes);

// Send notification
import { triggerNotification } from '../services/notificationService';
await triggerNotification('delivered', variables);
```

### Agent 2 (Admin & Reports)
**Recommended:**
1. Use `exportService.ts` for report generation
2. Use `notificationService.ts` for system alerts
3. Integrate audit trails from all services
