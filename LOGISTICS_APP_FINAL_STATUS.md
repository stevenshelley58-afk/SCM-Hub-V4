## 🎓 **Key Concepts Explained**

### **What is SLA?**
**Service Level Agreement** = Target time to complete a task

**Example:**
- Task created: 9:00 AM
- Priority: High
- SLA: 4 hours
- **Target:** 1:00 PM
- Completed at 12:45 PM = ✅ On Time
- Completed at 1:15 PM = ❌ SLA Breach

The system:
- Calculates SLA automatically
- Considers business hours
- Warns at 80% (configurable)
- Alerts on breach
- Tracks compliance rate

### **What is Multi-Site Configuration?**
Different sites = different requirements:

**Site QLD:**
- Photos: 2 minimum + signature required
- SLA High: 4 hours
- Business hours: 7am-5pm Mon-Fri

**Site NSW:**
- Photos: 1 minimum, no signature
- SLA High: 2 hours  
- Business hours: 6am-6pm Mon-Sat

**Site VIC:**
- Photos: optional
- SLA High: 8 hours
- Business hours: 24/7

All configured in `siteConfig.ts` - **zero code changes needed!**
